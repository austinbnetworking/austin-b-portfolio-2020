	<h1>Caring for Alaskan Breeds</h1>

	<p>
		The weather in Alaska can get particularly cold! So, making sure you are taking care of yourself and your loved ones is essential. Our pets are like our family so taking good care of them is all the same. Some of the best dogs to have in Alaskan climates include Tibetan mastiff/Terrier, Saint Bernard’s, Newfoundland’s, Malamutes, and in general Huskies. The reason many of these dogs are well versed is there thick coats of fur, and big bodies that keep them warm and reliable in cold weather. Caring for these animals is a huge factor in their lifespan and overall mental health.

		Like with any dog they need to be trained well and obedient. Alaskan dogs are no different! The only difference is our beloved friends are exposed more to the elements. Good training will include early socialization, basic obedience training, and overall good manners. Making a training exercise that is fun, and routine is going to set a good foundation. Don’t be afraid to reward for good behavior!

		When caring for a dog, you need to keep in mind the cleanliness and grooming. Not only do we want to keep our dogs looking beautiful but allowing a dirty build-up in their coat will result in possible infections. To keep dogs happy, and healthy we should use good practice of brushing and bathing when they are getting dirty. Huskies can be brushed few times a week, while malamutes and some other dogs need to be brushed every day!
	</p>

	<p>
		High quality dogs require some high-quality upkeep! When caring for these cold-climate friends always use the highest quality dog food you can obtain. Table scraps should be used sparingly to reward good behavior but may cause digestive upset. The biggest thing is buying a safe healthy food that is appropriate for the dogs age, whether a puppy, adult, or senior.
