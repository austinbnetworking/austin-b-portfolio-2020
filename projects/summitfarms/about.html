	<h1>About Alaskan Dogs</h1>

	<h2>Alaskan Husky</h2>
	<p>
		Alaskan Husky's are not actually considered a purebreed. They are defined by their purpse of being great sled dogs! They are moderate in size averaging 40 to 60 pounds in males and 35 to 55 in females. The awesome thing is they dont have a set color or marking, that really depends on their genetics. They are known to be very affectionate and great family oriented dogs!
	</p>

	<h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2>
	<p>
		The Alaskan Malamute is very strong and stable breed of domestic dog. They have great strength and endurance originally used to haul freight, and even sleds! They are a heavy dog known to be upwards of 70 pounds in females and 80 pounds in males. Commonly you will see them in black and white shades. Independant, intelligent, and beautiful can be used to describe them. 
	</p>

	<h2>Alaskan Klee Kai</h2>
	<p>
		Alaskan Klee Kai's are similar in looks to a malamute. They are from the spitz family. The only difference is the size, as these companion-sized dogs range from 5 to 22 pounds. They are quite small and surely wont be pulling any sleds!
	</p>

	<h2>American Eskimo</h2>
	<p>
		American Eskimo's are also apart of the spitz family. They are small companion dogs full of fur. They range in different sized commonly known as Toy(5-10 pounds), Miniature(10-20 pounds), and Standar(15-40 pounds). Interestingly, this breed has a german ancestry but due to an anti-German sentiment in WW1, it was renamed to American Eskimo.  
	</p>

	<h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
	<p>
		Another spitz family memeber here is the Siberian Husky. These are quite popular dogs. They are a good middle size typically no bigger than 60 pounds. They have an extra thick double fur coat which make them reliable cold-weather dogs. They are able withstand tempuratures as low as -50 to -60 C! They originated in Northeast Asia where they were bred for sled pulling.
	</p>

	<h2>Samoyed</h2>
	<p>
		The Samoyed is a long-living graceful dog. They have an all white fur coat that is very durable in cold weathers. This is why they were bred for hard work and sledding in tempuratures as low as -60! They are smart and demand attention. Ranging from 35-65 Pounds.
